                <p>The Federal Government has been criticized over the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. <br>
                   Deji Adeyanju, convener of Concerned Nigerians, said it's unacceptable that the Federal Government can't properly fund public universities. <br>                   
                   He lamented that the public university system in Nigeria is built to frustrate students and lecturers.                    
                   In a chat with DAILY POST on Sunday, <br> the Abuja-based lawyer and rights activist, said the government wastes billions on irrelevant things but can't fund education.
                   Adeyanju further <br> backed the decision of ASUU to remain on strike.<button>Read More</button></p>

                <img src="./image/Vladimir-Putin.jpeg.webp" alt="President Putin">
                <p>The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, has revealed why the country's President, Vladimir Putin ordered a military invasion of Ukraine. <br>
                   Lavrov said Putin ordered the attack to free Ukraine from oppression. In a press conference on Friday in Moscow, the Minister said the military action <br> was to
                   create an avenue for Ukrainians to decide their future.
                   According to Lavrov, Putin wants to “free Ukraine from oppression”, as Russian invading forces <br> approached Kyiv on the second day of the Kremlin's attack.
                   “Russian President Vladimir Putin took the decision to conduct a special military operation to <br> demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine so that, freed from oppression, 
                   Ukrainians themselves could freely determine their future,” he said.

                   <h2 id="even">Nigeria vs Ghana: Real reason I didn't become Super Eagles coach - Jose Peseiro </h2>
                   <img src="./image/Jose-Peseiro.jpeg.webp" alt="coach Jose"">
                   <p>Former Real Madrid assistant manager, Jose Peseiro has given a reason he did not become the head coach of the Super Eagles of Nigeria. <br>
                      Recall that the NFF had announced Peseiro as the next substantive coach of the Super Eagles, only a week after Augustine Eguavoen was <br> put in charge on an interim 
                      basis following the sacking of Gernot Rohr a few months ago.
                      Eguavoen stepped down from the Super Eagles <br> interim coaching job immediately after Tunisia knocked Nigeria out of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon.
                      However, the <br> NFF on Monday explained why Peseiro would no longer take over the Super Eagles and retained Eguavoen to continue as head coach, while also <br>
                      drafting in former international, Emmanuel Amuneke, to assist him ahead of Nigeria's FIFA World Cup qualifiers with Ghana in March.
